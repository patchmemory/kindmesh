## Detailed Status

### 1. Convert to a Proper Python Package
- **Status**: âœ… Completed
- **Completed Steps**: 
  - Created pyproject.toml in the root directory with the configuration specified in roadmap_05.md
  - Included all dependencies and entry points
  - Set up package metadata and classifiers

### 2. Restructure Project
- **Status**: ðŸ”„ In Progress
- **Completed Steps**:
  - Created kindmesh/ directory for the main package code
  - Created __init__.py files for kindmesh and kindmesh/utils
  - Created kindmesh/app.py with updated imports
  - Copied graph.py to kindmesh/utils with updated imports
- **Next Steps**:
  - Move remaining app/ files into kindmesh/
  - Organize scripts, docker, and tests directories

### 3. Create Entry Points
- **Status**: âœ… Completed
- **Completed Steps**:
  - Added entry points to pyproject.toml
  - Verified app.py already had a main() function

### 4. Update Import Statements
- **Status**: âœ… Completed
- **Completed Steps**:
  - Updated imports in kindmesh/app.py to use absolute imports
  - Updated import in graph.py from app.password_policy to kindmesh.password_policy

### 5. Create Neo4j Tutorial Notebook
- **Status**: âœ… Completed
- **Completed Steps**:
  - Created notebooks/ directory
  - Created neo4j_tutorial.ipynb with the content provided in roadmap_05.md

### 6. Update Installation Scripts
- **Status**: âœ… Completed
- **Completed Steps**:
  - Updated local_setup.sh to install the package in development mode
  - Added error handling for the installation process

### 7. Create Installation Guide
- **Status**: âœ… Completed
- **Completed Steps**:
  - Created INSTALL.md with clear instructions for installation
  - Included PyPI, source, and script-based installation methods
  - Added sections for Neo4j setup, environment variables, and troubleshooting

### 8. Additional Improvements
- **Status**: ðŸ”„ In Progress
- **Completed Steps**:
  - Created MANIFEST.in to include non-Python files in the package
  - Set up pre-commit hooks for code quality checks
- **Next Steps**:
  - Add type hints to functions and methods
  - Ensure all functions and classes have proper docstrings

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Basic Package Structure**
   - Create pyproject.toml
   - Restructure project directories
   - Create __init__.py files

2. **Phase 2: Code Updates**
   - Update import statements
   - Add entry points
   - Add type hints and docstrings

3. **Phase 3: Documentation and Tools**
   - Create Neo4j tutorial notebook
   - Create installation guide
   - Add MANIFEST.in
   - Set up pre-commit hooks

4. **Phase 4: Testing and Deployment**
   - Update installation scripts
   - Test installation process
   - Test application functionality
   - Prepare for PyPI deployment (if applicable)

## Next Immediate Actions

1. Complete the restructuring by moving remaining app/ files into kindmesh/
2. Add type hints to key functions and methods
3. Ensure all functions and classes have proper docstrings
4. Test the package installation and functionality

## Conclusion

Significant progress has been made in converting kindmesh to a proper Python package. The core infrastructure is now in place with the creation of pyproject.toml, package directory structure, entry points, and installation scripts. The Neo4j tutorial notebook has been created to help users understand how to connect to the database and run queries.

The remaining tasks focus on completing the restructuring of the codebase and enhancing code quality through type hints and docstrings. Once these tasks are completed, the package will fully adhere to PEP standards and provide a smooth installation experience for users.

The project is now much closer to being a standards-compliant Python package that can be easily installed via pip and used by developers and end-users alike.
