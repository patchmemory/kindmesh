## Next Steps

Based on the progress made and the priorities identified in roadmap_08.md, the following tasks should be prioritized next:

1. **Complete Testing Framework**:
   - Create test database fixtures
   - Implement unit tests for core modules

2. **Complete Documentation**:
   - Generate comprehensive API documentation
   - Create administrator and end-user guides

3. **Start Containerization**:
   - Optimize Dockerfile
   - Enhance docker-compose setup

## Timeline Update

The original timeline from roadmap_08.md remains valid, with the following adjustments:

- Week 1: Testing framework setup and Documentation framework setup ‚úÖ
- Week 2: Core module tests and API documentation
- Week 3: Business logic tests and User guides
- Week 4: Integration tests and Containerization

## Conclusion

Significant progress has been made on setting up the testing and documentation frameworks. The project now has a solid foundation for testing with pytest and documentation with Sphinx. The next steps will focus on completing the testing and documentation tasks, followed by containerization.
