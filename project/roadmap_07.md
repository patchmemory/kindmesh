## Detailed Status

### 1. Convert to a Proper Python Package
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Completed Steps**: 
  - Created pyproject.toml in the root directory with the configuration specified in roadmap_05.md
  - Included all dependencies and entry points
  - Set up package metadata and classifiers

### 2. Restructure Project
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Completed Steps**:
  - Created kindmesh/ directory for the main package code
  - Created __init__.py files for kindmesh and kindmesh/utils
  - Moved all app/ files to kindmesh/ with updated imports:
    - app.py → kindmesh/app.py
    - auth.py → kindmesh/auth.py
    - batch_entry.py → kindmesh/batch_entry.py
    - data_view.py → kindmesh/data_view.py
    - enhanced_interaction.py → kindmesh/enhanced_interaction.py
    - export.py → kindmesh/export.py
    - interaction.py → kindmesh/interaction.py
    - manage_data.py → kindmesh/manage_data.py
    - password_policy.py → kindmesh/password_policy.py
    - recipient.py → kindmesh/recipient.py
    - survey.py → kindmesh/survey.py
    - user_management.py → kindmesh/user_management.py
    - utils/graph.py → kindmesh/utils/graph.py

### 3. Create Entry Points
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Completed Steps**:
  - Added entry points to pyproject.toml
  - Verified app.py already had a main() function

### 4. Update Import Statements
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Completed Steps**:
  - Updated all imports in kindmesh/ files to use absolute imports
  - Updated import in graph.py from app.password_policy to kindmesh.password_policy
  - Updated imports in enhanced_interaction.py and manage_data.py to use kindmesh package

### 5. Create Neo4j Tutorial Notebook
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Completed Steps**:
  - Created notebooks/ directory
  - Created neo4j_tutorial.ipynb with the content provided in roadmap_05.md

### 6. Update Installation Scripts
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Completed Steps**:
  - Updated local_setup.sh to install the package in development mode
  - Added error handling for the installation process

### 7. Create Installation Guide
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Completed Steps**:
  - Created INSTALL.md with clear instructions for installation
  - Included PyPI, source, and script-based installation methods
  - Added sections for Neo4j setup, environment variables, and troubleshooting

### 8. Additional Improvements
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Completed Steps**:
  - Created MANIFEST.in to include non-Python files in the package
  - Set up pre-commit hooks for code quality checks
  - Added type hints to all functions in the kindmesh package
  - Improved docstrings for all functions following PEP 257

## Next Steps

Now that the kindmesh package has been properly structured and documented, the following steps could be considered for future development:

1. **Testing**: Create comprehensive unit tests for the package
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up continuous integration and deployment
3. **Documentation**: Generate API documentation using tools like Sphinx
4. **PyPI Publication**: Prepare the package for publication on PyPI
5. **Containerization**: Improve Docker setup for easier deployment

## Conclusion

All tasks identified in roadmap_06.md have been successfully completed. The kindmesh project is now a properly structured Python package that follows PEP standards and can be easily installed via pip. The codebase has been enhanced with proper type hints and docstrings, making it more maintainable and developer-friendly.

The project is now ready for testing, deployment, and further development. The restructuring and documentation improvements will make it easier for new contributors to understand and extend the codebase.
