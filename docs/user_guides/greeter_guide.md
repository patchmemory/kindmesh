## Dashboard Overview

When you log in as a Greeter, you'll see a simple dashboard with the user creation form. The interface is focused on your primary task of creating new users for the system.

## Creating New Users

As a Greeter, you can create new user accounts with the Friend role. Here's how to create a new user:

1. Log in to your Greeter account
2. On the dashboard, locate the "Create New User" form
3. Enter a username for the new user
   - Usernames must be unique in the system
   - Choose descriptive but concise usernames
   - Avoid using personally identifiable information
4. Enter a password for the new user
   - Choose a strong password that combines letters, numbers, and special characters
   - The password should be at least 8 characters long
5. Confirm the password by entering it again
6. Click the "Create User" button to create the account

If the user creation is successful, you'll see a confirmation message. If there's an error, you'll see an error message explaining what went wrong.

## Best Practices

### Username Selection

- Use consistent naming conventions for all users
- Consider using role-based prefixes (e.g., "friend_john")
- Avoid using full names or other personally identifiable information
- Document the username provided to each user

### Password Security

- Generate strong, unique passwords for each user
- Consider using a password manager to generate and store passwords
- Provide the password to the user through a secure channel
- Instruct users to change their password after first login

### User Onboarding

- Provide new users with the appropriate user guide based on their role
- Explain the importance of keeping their credentials secure
- Show new users how to log in and navigate the system
- Be available to answer questions during their initial use of the system

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Username Already Exists

If you see an error message stating that the username already exists:
1. Try a different username
2. Check with other Greeters to see if they've recently created a user with that name
3. Contact an Admin if you believe the username should be available

#### Password Mismatch

If you see an error message stating that the passwords do not match:
1. Carefully re-enter both passwords
2. Make sure there are no extra spaces before or after the password
3. Check if caps lock is enabled

#### System Errors

If you encounter any system errors while creating users:
1. Note the exact error message
2. Try logging out and logging back in
3. Contact an Admin with the error details
